### Markdown Formatting Tips:
- Use `#` for headers (`#` for main header, `##` for sub-headers).
- Use `-` or `*` for bullet points.
- Enclose code snippets in triple backticks (\`\`\`) with the language identifier (e.g., `javascript`) for syntax highlighting.
- Include links using `[link text](URL)` syntax.

### Usage on GitHub:
1. Copy the Markdown text into a new file named `README.md` in your GitHub repository.
2. Commit and push the `README.md` file to your GitHub repository.
3. GitHub will automatically render the Markdown text into a formatted document on your repository's main page.

This format will effectively present your project details on GitHub, making it easy for visitors to understand your project's objectives, features, and how to get started with it.
